Programming Knowledge
`````````````````````
    0. What is a programming language?
        It is a language used to talk with computers
        (As we have many languages to speak, similarly computers also have many programming languages)

    1. Actually there is know soln for this problem
        (As an ethical hacker one must have basic understanding of all programming languages)
    2. One should able to understand the syntax and logic behind the existing code
    3. For building custom softwares and tools of your own
    4. Attempting to reverse engineer code and finding Exploits in code
    5. For solving a problem sometimes we need programming knowledge
    6. Few Programming languages are
        * C/C++
        * Python
        * HTML
        * JavaScript
        * PHP
        * SQL
        * Bash
        * Assembly

        C/C++
        `````
            - 90% of all Operating System and other language libraries today we use are written in C/C++
            (Even all the background of python runs on C)
        Python
        ``````
            - Easy to learn
            - Automating tasks (Interpreted Language)
            - Wide language used and top trending language
            - Also used as Backend language in web(FrameWorks: flask, django)
        HTML
        ````
            - All the web pages contains HTML so understanding of HTML is necessary
              (Login forms and other data entry methods on the web use HTML forms to get data.
               Been able to write and interpret HTML, makes it easy for you to identify and
               exploit weaknesses in the code.)
        PHP
        ```
            - PHP is the most popular Backend language for web
              (Most websites today are coded in PHP)
              (But increasing in trends people are moving to new language like python(django) and JavaScript(Node))
        JavaScript
        ``````````
            - Almost all websites use frontend as JavaScript
            - There is a most famous exploit called (CROSS SITE SCRIPTING)
            - javascript is used as both frontend and backend language now-a-days(FrameWorks:Node)
        SQL
        ```
            - Everything in the internet is strored in databases
            - SQL is the language of the databases
              (For talking with databases SQL knowledge is necessary)
            - increasing in trends developers are choosing new database technologies like
                ^ postgresql
                ^ NOSQL...
            - Well known popular attack known as SQL Injection
            - As it is a client side language we are able to perform client side attacks using JS
        Bash
        ````
            - Most Ethical Hackers use linux Distributions
            - Linux terminal provides programming on kernal
            - for writing terminal code BASH scripting is used
            - For automating daily tasks Bash can be used
        Assembly
        ````````
            - For attacking at processor level Assembly language is important
            - As processor can understand Assembly language only


Computer Networking
```````````````````
    1. One should how data is being transferred from one device to another device
        (so that we can manipulate and can perform man in the middle attacks)
        (As a client we make requests to the server and server responds back with
         a response inorder to understand all this phenomenon Networking is necessary)
    2. Basic knowledge of protocols and ports are important
        (Computer Networks is the Backbone of the internet to understand things
         which are going on the internet networking knowledge is mandatory as internet
         follows those protocols we can find vulnerabilities and exploit them)
    3. During Information Gathering phase one should able to know open/closed ports os
        and other details of the target System/Server
        ( For System scanning and knowledge of ports networking knowledge is necessary)
        (Scanning is a set of procedures for identifying live hosts, ports & services)
    4. Sniffing packets
        (Monitering & capturing packets through a given network)
        (Example: phone tapping)
    5. Understanding and performing attacks like DoS
        (Denial of Service is an attack performed at the physical layer which makes the
         Server busy by reaching maximum number of user or by exhausting band width
         All the above stuff is networking concepts) 


Linux Distributions
```````````````````
    1. Most web servers are run on the Linux operating system.
       (As an ethical hacker, one of your most frequent roles will be to gain access to the server.
        This automatically makes Linux a must-have skill for ethical hacking.
        You should have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of this operating system.)
    2. Some of the linux destros for hackers are
        - Kali Linux
        - BackBox
        - Parrot Security OS
        - BlackArch

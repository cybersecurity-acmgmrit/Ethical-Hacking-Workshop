    Common types of Cyber Attacks
    ``````````````````````````````

* Malware ( Malicious Software )
    Malwares enters into a network or system via vulnerability or by
    social engineering attacks like clicking unknown links that downloads
    malware into our system

    - Spyware
        ~ Gathers Information and sends to the hacker without the victims knowledge
    - Ransomware
        ~ Name itself suggests that it is a type of malware which encrypts
          victims data and made inaccessible to the victim. Attacker demands
          some ransome inorder to decrypt the data
    - Virus and
        ~ Modifies the existing code so that system working fails
        ~ As it name suggests it replicates itself and attacks other devices
    - Worms
        ~ Worms are also similar to viruses attacking on a network

* Phishing
    - Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent communications that
      appear to come from a reputable source, usually through email.

    - The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login
      information or to install malware on the victim’s machine.

    - Phishing is an increasingly common cyberthreat

* Man-in-the-Middle-Attack (MitM) (Eavesdropping Attack)
    - In MitM attacks attacker pretends himself as the original source or
      destination but serves in between you and the server so that he can
      capture all your traffic.

    - Common MitM Attacks
        ~ On unsecure public Wi-Fi, attackers can insert themselves between
          a visitor’s device and the network. Without knowing,
          the visitor passes all information through the attacker.

        ~ Once malware has breached a device, an attacker can install
          a software to process all of the victim’s information.

* Denial-of-service-attack
    - A denial-of-service attack floods systems, servers, or networks with
      traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth

    - As a result, the system is unable to fulfill legitimate requests.

    - Attackers can also use multiple compromised devices to launch this attack.
      This is known as a distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

* Code Injections
    - SQL Injection
        ~ malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution
    - Cross-site-Scripting (XSS)

* Zero-Day-Attack
    - It is an attack that launched on the same as vulnerability founds means

    - When a vulnerability is found in a software attacking the software and
      it's users before releasing a patch for it

    - Thatswhy we have to use upto date softwares and apps
